    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A nice zippy chicken curry balanced out by the sweetness of coconut milk. This recipe is very basic and easy to
        customize to your taste. I have added hearts of palm, bamboo shoots, pineapple, mushrooms, onions or
        shallots...have fun with it!
    </p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp curry paste, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tsp chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a
            solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about
            1/2 inch. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat, and pan-fry the chicken breasts until the meat is no
            longer pink, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken breasts to a plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium; stir the green onions and curry paste into the skillet, and cook for 1 minute,
            stirring frequently. Pour the broth into the skillet, and scrape up and dissolve any brown flavor bits in
            the skillet with a spoon. Bring the mixture to a full boil, and cook until the mixture has thickened into a
            glaze, about 10 minutes; pour in the coconut milk, bring back to a boil, and cook until thickened, about 10
            more minutes. Mix the lime juice into the sauce, and stir in any juices that have collected from the
            chicken. Return the chicken breasts to the pan, spoon sauce over the chicken, and simmer until heated
            through, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.</li>
    </ol>
